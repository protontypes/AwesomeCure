For more information on how this dataset was created, please refer to the final report KK: ADD LINK. To make the study transparent and reproducible all plots and scores within the study are created by this document. The notebook is intended to help interested readers draw their own conclusions from the data set. Not all plots generated here have to be part of the report.

    "The creation of the raw data sets already requires several steps in the preprocessing of the data. All projects are selected based on the [contribution guide](https://opensustain.tech/contributing/) of OpenSustain.tech. The Contribution Guide restricts the listed projects to those that hold an opensource license, such as MIT or GNU GPLv3. Since git repositories are by far the most widely used tool for collaboration in open source projects, the vast majority entries are within a git repository. \n",

    "In order to bring the database together, different methods were used over a period of 2 years to identify as many projects as possible within the topic area, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Proactive investigation on GitHub, Gitlab, and BitBucket.\n",
    "* Crowdsourcing by 30+ contributors and many anonymous tips.\n",

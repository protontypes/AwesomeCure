Other species do work well though"")\n\nWBIA program for the storage and management of images and derived data for use in computer vision algorithms. It aims to compute who an animal is, what species an animal is, and where an animal is with the ultimate goal being to ask important why biological questions.\n\nThis project is the Machine Learning (ML) / computer vision component of the WildBook project: See https://github.com/WildMeOrg/.  This project is an actively maintained fork of the popular IBEIS (Image Based Ecological Information System) software suite for wildlife conservation.  The original IBEIS project is maintained by Jon Crall (@Erotemic) at https://github.com/Erotemic/ibeis.  The IBEIS toolkit originally was a wrapper around HotSpotter, which original binaries can be downloaded from: http://cs.rpi.edu/hotspotter/\n\nCurrently the system is build around a SQLite database, a web GUI, and matplotlib visualizations. Algorithms employed are: convolutional neural network detection and localization and classification, hessian-affine keypoint detection, SIFT keypoint description, LNBNN identification using approximate nearest neighbors.\n\nSupport\n--------\nWhile WBIA can be set up independently, the Wild Me team is not able to assist with independent model training. Support is limited to system setup in Docker at this time.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n* Python 3.7+\n* OpenCV 3.4.10\n* Python dependencies listed in requirements.txt\n\nInstallation Instructions\n-------------------------\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    git clone https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wildbook-ia.git\n    cd wildbook-ia/devops\n    sudo ./build.sh wbia-base wbia-provision wbia\n\nIf your build times out, run the command again. The previous run is cached and the build will advance. Note that you cannot tag this build.\n\nDocker\n~~~~~~\n\nThe WBIA software is built and deployed as a Docker image `wildme/wbia`.  You can download and run the pre-configured instance from the command line using:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    # Install Docker - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/\n    docker pull wildme/wbia:latest\n    docker run -p 84:5000 wildme/wbia:latest bash\n\nThis image is built using the multi-stage Dockerfiles in `devops/`. Once the container is up and running, go to `localhost:84` to see the WBIA landing page.\n\nDependencies\n~~~~~~\n\nThis project depends on an array of other repositories for functionality.\n\nFirst Party Toolkits (Required)\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-utool\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-vtool\n\nFirst Party Dependencies for Third Party Libraries (Required)\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-tpl-pyhesaff\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-tpl-pyflann\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-tpl-pydarknet\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-tpl-pyrf\n\nFirst Party Plug-ins (Optional)\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-plugin-cnn\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-plugin-flukematch\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-plugin-deepsense\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-plugin-finfindr\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-plugin-curvrank\n\n    + https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-tpl-curvrank\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-plugin-kaggle7\n\n    + https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-tpl-kaggle7\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-plugin-2d-orientation\n\n    + https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-tpl-2d-orientation\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-plugin-lca\n\n    + https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-tpl-lca\n\nDeprecated Toolkits (Deprecated)\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-deprecate-ubelt\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-deprecate-dtool\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-deprecate-guitool\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-deprecate-plottool\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-deprecate-detecttools\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-deprecate-plugin-humpbacktl\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-deprecate-tpl-lightnet\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-deprecate-tpl-brambox\n\nPlug-in Templates (Reference)\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-plugin-template\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-plugin-id-example\n\nMiscellaneous (Reference)\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-pypkg-build\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-project-website\n\n* https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wbia-aws-codedeploy\n\nCitation\n--------\n\nIf you use this code or its models in your research, please cite:\n\n.. code:: text\n\n    @inproceedings{crall2013hotspotter,\n        title={Hotspotter \xe2\x80\x94 patterned species instance recognition},\n        author={Crall, Jonathan P and Stewart, Charles V and Berger-Wolf, Tanya Y and Rubenstein, Daniel I and Sundaresan, Siva R},\n        booktitle={2013 IEEE workshop on applications of computer vision (WACV)},\n        pages={230--237},\n        year={2013},\n        organization={IEEE}\n    }\n\n    @inproceedings{parham2018animal,\n        title={An animal detection pipeline for identification},\n        author={Parham, Jason and Stewart, Charles and Crall, Jonathan and Rubenstein, Daniel and Holmberg, Jason and Berger-Wolf, Tanya},\n        booktitle={2018 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)},\n        pages={1075--1083},\n        year={2018},\n        organization={IEEE}\n    }\n\n    @inproceedings{berger2015ibeis,\n        title={IBEIS: Image-based ecological information system: From pixels to science and conservation},\n        author={Berger-Wolf, TY and Rubenstein, DI and Stewart, CV and Holmberg, J and Parham, J and Crall, J},\n        booktitle={Bloomberg Data for Good Exchange Conference, New York, NY, USA},\n        volume={2},\n        year={2015}\n    }\n\n    @article{berger2017wildbook,\n        title={Wildbook: Crowdsourcing, computer vision, and data science for conservation},\n        author={Berger-Wolf, Tanya Y and Rubenstein, Daniel I and Stewart, Charles V and Holmberg, Jason A and Parham, Jason and Menon, Sreejith and Crall, Jonathan and Van Oast, Jon and Kiciman, Emre and Joppa, Lucas},\n        journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.08880},\n        year={2017}\n    }\n\nDocumentation\n-------------------------\n\nThe documentation is built and available online at `wildmeorg.github.io/wildbook-ia/ <http://wildmeorg.github.io/wildbook-ia/>`_.

(See also `pre-commit.com <https://pre-commit.com/>`_)\n\nReference `pre-commit\'s installation instructions <https://pre-commit.com/#install>`_ for software installation on your OS/platform. After you have the software installed, run ``pre-commit install`` on the command line. Now every time you commit to this project\'s code base the linter procedures will automatically run over the changed files.  To run pre-commit on files preemtively from the command line use:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    git add .\n    pre-commit run\n\n    # or\n\n    pre-commit run --all-files\n\nBrunette\n~~~~~~~~\n\nOur code base has been formatted by Brunette, which is a fork and more configurable version of Black (https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n\nFlake8\n~~~~~~\n\nTry to conform to PEP8.  You should set up your preferred editor to use flake8 as its Python linter, but pre-commit will ensure compliance before a git commit is completed.\n\nTo run flake8 from the command line use:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    flake8\n\n\nThis will use the flake8 configuration within ``setup.cfg``,\nwhich ignores several errors and stylistic considerations.\nSee the ``setup.cfg`` file for a full and accurate listing of stylistic codes to ignore.\n\nPyTest\n~~~~~~\n\nOur code uses Google-style documentation tests (doctests) that uses pytest and xdoctest to enable full support.  To run the tests from the command line use:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pytest\n\nTo run doctests with `+REQUIRES(--web-tests)` do:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pytest --web-tests\n\n.. |Build| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/WildMeOrg/wildbook-ia/Build%20and%20upload%20to%20PyPI/main\n    :target: https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wildbook-ia/actions?query=branch%3Amain+workflow%3A%22Build+and+upload+to+PyPI%22\n    :alt: Build and upload to PyPI\n\n.. |Pypi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/wildbook-ia.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wildbook-ia\n   :alt: Latest PyPI version\n\n.. |Documentation| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/WildMeOrg/wildbook-ia/Build%20documentation?label=documentation\n    :target: https://wildmeorg.github.io/wildbook-ia/\n    :alt: Documentation on GitHub Pages\n\n.. |Downloads| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/wildbook-ia.svg\n   :target: https://pypistats.org/packages/wildbook-ia\n'",,"2016/10/06, 04:49:07",2769,Apache-2.0,159,11249,"2024/04/08, 15:24:45",4,257,271,43,28,0,0.8,0.50963096309631,"2023/04/25, 06:48:30",v4.0.4,0,27,false,,false,false,,,https://github.com/WildMeOrg,https://wildme.org,"Portland, OR",,,https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20192494?v=4,,

Any time the ``main`` branch is updated or a tagged release is made (see the PyPI instructions below), an automated GitHub CD action will build and deploy the newest image to Docker Hub automatically.\n\nTo do this manually, use the code below:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    docker login\n\n    export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1\n    export DOCKER_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL=enabled\n    docker buildx create --name multi-arch-builder --use\n\n    docker buildx build \\\n        -t wildme/scoutbot:latest \\\n        --platform linux/amd64 \\\n        --push \\\n        .\n\nPyPI\n====\n\nTo upload the latest ScoutBot version to the Python Package Index (PyPI), follow the steps below:\n\n#. Edit ``scoutbot/__init__.py:65`` and set ``VERSION`` to the desired version\n\n    .. code-block:: python\n\n        VERSION = \'X.Y.Z\'\n\n\n#. Push any changes and version update to the ``main`` branch on GitHub and wait for CI tests to pass\n\n    .. code-block:: bash\n\n        git pull origin main\n        git commit -am ""Release for Version X.Y.Z""\n        git push origin main\n\n\n#. Tag the ``main`` branch as a new release using the `SemVer pattern <https://semver.org/>`_ (e.g., ``vX.Y.Z``)\n\n    .. code-block:: bash\n\n        git pull origin main\n        git tag vX.Y.Z\n        git push origin vX.Y.Z\n\n\n#. Wait for the automated GitHub CD actions to build and push to `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/scoutbot/>`_ and `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/wildme/scoutbot>`_.\n\nTests and Coverage\n------------------\n\nYou can run the automated tests in the ``tests/`` folder by running:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install -r requirements.optional.txt\n    pytest\n\nYou may also get a coverage percentage by running:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    coverage html\n\nand open the `coverage/html/index.html` file in your browser.\n\nBuilding Documentation\n----------------------\n\nThere is Sphinx documentation in the ``docs/`` folder, which can be built by running:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    cd docs/\n    pip install -r requirements.optional.txt\n    sphinx-build -M html . build/\n\nLogging\n-------\n\nThe script uses Python\'s built-in logging functionality called ``logging``.  All print functions are replaced with ``log.info()``, which sends the output to two places:\n\n#. the terminal window, and\n#. the file `scoutbot.log`\n\nCode Formatting\n---------------\n\nIt\'s recommended that you use ``pre-commit`` to ensure linting procedures are run\non any code you write.  See `pre-commit.com <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ for more information.\n\nReference `pre-commit\'s installation instructions <https://pre-commit.com/#install>`_ for software installation on your OS/platform. After you have the software installed, run ``pre-commit install`` on the command line. Now every time you commit to this project\'s code base the linter procedures will automatically run over the changed files.  To run pre-commit on files preemtively from the command line use:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install -r requirements.optional.txt\n    pre-commit run --all-files\n\nThe code base has been formatted by `Brunette <https://pypi.org/project/brunette/>`_, which is a fork and more configurable version of `Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.  Furthermore, try to conform to ``PEP8``.  You should set up your preferred editor to use ``flake8`` as its Python linter, but pre-commit will ensure compliance before a git commit is completed.  This will use the ``flake8`` configuration within ``setup.cfg``, which ignores several errors and stylistic considerations.
